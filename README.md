# AlphaSeq Antibody Datasets

To support protein representation learning, we published two datasets containing
quantitative binding scores of scFv-format antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2
target peptide collected via an AlphaSeq assay. Each dataset, associated license and descriptions are included in each
subdirectory. 

- antibody_dataset_1: Contains the initial AlphaSeq Antibody Dataset. Please
  refer to our [Data Descriptor
Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01779-4) for additional
information.

- antibody_dataset_2: Contains antibodies designed using a machine learning
  framework and empirically measured. Please refer to our paper [Machine
Learning Optimization of Candidate Antibodies Yields Highly Diverse
Sub-nanomolar Affinity Antibody
Libraries](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.502662v1) for
additional information.
